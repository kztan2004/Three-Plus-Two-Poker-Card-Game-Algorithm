The game "Three Plus Two Poker" is a card game typically played by two players. Here are the rules:

Prepare a standard deck of cards, removing the jokers, leaving 52 cards.
Shuffle the deck thoroughly and divide it into two equal piles, one for each player.
Each player separates their cards into three groups and two groups.
The point value of each group is determined by the last digit of the total point value. For example, if a group consists of a 10 and a 9, the total is 19, and the last digit is 9.
Each player first plays their three groups and then their two groups.
Add up the points of the two groups to get a two-digit or single-digit total. If it's a two-digit number, only the units digit is considered.
Compare the totals of the two players, and the player with the higher total wins.
For example, if one player's three groups are 6, 8, and 10, and their two groups are 7 and 9, their total would be (6+8+10) + (7+9) = 40. If the other player's total is 36, the first player wins.
